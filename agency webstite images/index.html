        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Earning an international degree is not only about expanding your career and 
            personal horizons but also about having an experience of a lifetime.
             We share reasons why you should consider studying internationally.We’ll walk you step-by-step
              through the entire application process.Studying abroad is a big step to take. All students get nervous about starting a new course but for international students you will be getting used to a new country, new city and potentially another language or accent.

              However, it's a great idea to talk openly about any concerns you have before applying with your family as well as one of our counsellors so that you are confident and ready to take the next step. Talking to other friends or teachers who have also studied overseas will also give you some valuable tips and real-life advice to consider.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">How do I apply?</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Our experienced counsellors will help you compile your application and certify the supporting documents. 
            Your counsellor will then submit your application on your behalf to your university or school of choice...You’ll need to bring documents to verify your identity (valid passport) and your certificates from GCE ‘O’ levels (original results/transcripts) onwards. 
            This will help your counsellor streamline your application.It takes four to six weeks to process a course application. It may take longer if it is during peak period or a holiday season. We know this can feel like a really long wait!
             We'll keep communicating with you during this time to help you keep calm and hope for the best.</p>
